* This website

First (Jan 2022) from ~sriar.github.io~ on Jekyll and Github Pages to a html+css website inspired (read stolen) from [[https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css][vincentdoerig/latex-css]]. This was because the ~latex-css~ theme had sidenotes@@html:<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Hello there!</span>@@, which are the closest to book footnotes that one can have on websites. But then I got a bit too annoyed with having to deal with html+css directly, and I had slowly started using ~org-mode~, which brings me to

Second (Jan 2023) from html+css to an org-mode project with the same css theme. I now have all the pages as ~.org~ files, which (hopefully) should be easier to maintain and customize. Separation of layout and content and so on, but I know how well that works with latex, so @@html:<i>*shrug*</i>@@.

* Unfinished business

I have tried (and tested) my hand at various things, at an average rate of once every two years.

- An unprinted [[doc:lovelettersynthwave.png][synthwave Love Letter deck]] on Gimp. The (original) game is amazing, try it out on [[https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=loveletter][BGA]] if you have an account.

- A half-finished [[doc:complablender.png][CMI computer lab]] on Blender. Needs some keyboards, chairs, and, most importantly, lights.

- A half-finished viXra paper on the domestication of dogs@@html:<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle">âŠ•</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">nope, not sharing it :P</span>@@.

- A decent amount of crosswords. Though some themes were nice, most of the (relatively) good ones have some injokes, and so are virtually unsolvable. I'll make a normal one eventually@@html:&#8482;@@ and post it here.
