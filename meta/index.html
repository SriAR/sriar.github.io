  <h5>This website</h5>
  <p>
  I have recently (Jan 2022) moved this personal website from <code>sriar.github.io</code> (hosted on Jekyll and Github Pages) to a pure html+css website inspired (read stolen) from <a href="https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css">vincentdoerig/latex-css</a>. I had wanted to migrate out of Github Pages for a long time, but what finally pushed me over was that this theme had sidenotes<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Hello there!</span>, which are the closest to book footnotes that I can have on websites. Gwern has <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Sidenotes">an article</a> on various implementations of sidenotes on the interwebz if you would like to add sidenotes to your website as well.

  <h5>Unfinished business</h5>
  <p>
  I have tried (and tested) my hand at various things, at an average rate of once every two years.
  <ul>
      <li>A half-finished <a href="../files/complablender.png">CMI computer lab</a> on Blender. Needs some keyboards, chairs, and, most importantly, lights.</li>
      <li>A half-finished viXra paper on the domestication of dogs<label for="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="sidenote-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">nope, not sharing it :P</span>.</li>
      <li>A decent amount of crosswords. Though some themes were nice, most of the (relatively) good ones have some injokes, and so are virtually unsolvable. I'll make a normal one eventually&#8482; and post it here.</li>
  </ul>
