<p>Yallo! I’ve recently joined the University of Vienna to work on dynamic algorithms, advised by Monika Henzinger. I completed my Masters in Computer Science and Bachelors in Maths+CS at Chennai Mathematical Institute. Great place, you really should go there some time.</p>
<h1 id="academic-interests">Academic interests</h1>
<p>I am broadly interested in the intersection of mathematics and computer science, and currently work on dynamic algorithms. I have also worked in (algorithmic+) game theory, specifically on fair division and on completely mixed strategies.</p>
<p>There are a few books nominally unrelated to my work that I’d like to read but haven’t had a chance to yet, so let me know if you’re interested in teaming up to read any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>✓ <del><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-76649-0">Using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem</a> by Jiří Matoušek</del></li>
<li><a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/abcde.html">Computers and Typesetting</a> by Don Knuth</li>
<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8">Proofs from THE BOOK</a> by Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="books">Books</h1>
<p>I, like others who grew up without siblings and decided to make “I read books” a personality trait, have a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/8544194?order=d&amp;sort=date_read">Goodreads account</a>. I’m always looking for new recommendations, and if you’d like some fiction suggestions,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4934.The_Brothers_Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119512.The_Melancholy_of_Resistance">The Melancholy of Resistance</a> by László Krasznahorkai</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068838-catastrophe">Catastrophe: And Other Stories</a> by Dino Buzzati</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="linux">Linux</h1>
<p>I currently have an Arch Linux installation on my laptop, with <a href="https://github.com/SriAR/dotfiles">these dotfiles</a>. Some things of interest to you might be my:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SriAR/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/vimrc">vimrc</a> - with comments.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SriAR/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/zinc">zinc</a> - a custom file syncer using rsync. I use my university-provided computer space as cloud space for my academic PDFs, and use <strong>zinc</strong> to keep them synced between my laptop, phone, iPad and the univie server.</li>
<li>I also have some tex snippets from <a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1">this amazing blog post</a> adapted to my use case.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="dota2">DotA2</h1>
<p>I have spent a small portion of my life playing DotA2, and a smaller portion of it watching the game. I have nothing more to say about it, but it just felt weird not having a section in my homepage not dedicated to this game. If you’d like an introduction to the game, look no further than Purge’s <a href="https://purgegamers.true.io/g/dota-2-guide/#welcome-to-dota-you-suck">Welcome to Dota, you suck</a>. In my unbounded queue of things I would like to do also resides the wish to write CS articles with similar titles.</p>

<h1 id="music">Music</h1>
<p>Songs/albums that I’ve been listening to on repeat recently. I’ll definitely keep this section updated, I swear (May 2022).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5aMav6q-o0">Achilles, Come Down</a> - Gang of Youths</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRW4pSg64WY">Quedate Luna (Rework)</a> - Natalia Doco, Devendra Banhart</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSv04ylc6To">Abusey Junction</a> - Kokoroko</li>
