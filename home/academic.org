* Academic interests
I am broadly interested in the intersection of mathematics and computer science, and currently work on graph algorithms. I have also worked in (algorithmic+) game theory, specifically on fair division and on completely mixed strategies.

There are a few books nominally unrelated to my work that I’d like to read but haven’t had a chance to yet, so let me know if you’re interested in teaming up to read any of these:
