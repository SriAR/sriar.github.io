* Dota

I have spent a small portion of my life playing DotA2, and a smaller portion of it watching the game. I have nothing more to say about it, but it just felt weird not having a section in my homepage not dedicated to this game. If you’d like an introduction to the game, look no further than Purge’s [[https://purgegamers.true.io/g/dota-2-guide/#welcome-to-dota-you-suck][Welcome to Dota, you suck]]. In my unbounded queue of things I would like to do also resides the wish to write CS articles with similar titles.
