Hey! I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Vienna, advised by Monika Henzinger. I work on dynamic graph algorithms and differential privacy. I completed my Masters in Computer Science and Bachelors in Maths+CS at Chennai Mathematical Institute. Great place, you really should go there some time.
