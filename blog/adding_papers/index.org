#+title: Workflow I: Adding papers

*The problem*: I am reading a paper, I see a citation which I want to read/add to my library.

*Non-script solution*:
- Copy the title and search for it on dblp
- Download the bibtex file for the conference/journal version
- Download the arxiv pdf if available, else search for the conference version and download that
- Create a citekey and add tags and add it to library
- Update local paper database and push to server.

*Problem with this solution*: I do not like the amount of time I spend on dblp/internet. I want to script it so that, most of the time, I don't need to even alt-tab to add papers.

*Step 1: Downloading everything relevant*:
I use [[https://github.com/SriAR/biblio-baggins][my bib manager]] with ~bb --paper-add~. It does the following.

[[../../files/downloading.gif]]

- Assumes the title of the paper is in the clipboard
- Gives a list of papers to choose where to download the bib file from
- Gives a list of papers to choose where to download the pdf file from
- If the pdf is on arxiv, downloads it automatically and open the pdf, else opens the paper's url in firefox and simultaneously the paper title on google scholar.

*Step 2: Add citekey and tags*: Once a bib file and pdf file are downloaded, I use [[https://github.com/SriAR/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/paperadd][a bash script]] which does

[[../../files/add_citekey.gif]]

- Run ~alpha.bst~ on the bib file to create a alpha-style citekey. If you don't recall, this is the ~BSS14~ or ~She17~ style citekeys.
- Ask for a keyword to add to the citekey, which would be appended to the above citekey. For example, ~BSS14sparse~ or ~She17areaconvex~.
- Give a list of existing tags to choose from, where you can add new tags if needed. All these tags are linked to the paper. For example, ~laplacian~, ~sparsification~, ~convexopt~. This is available when searching for papers to open.

*Step 3: Sync*: Once I've added the paper to my library, I use [[https://github.com/SriAR/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/pe][a short bash script]] which runs
- Add this paper to the list I search from when I open papers, and to ~$HOME/texmf/bibtex/bib/GlobalRef.bib~. This is useful (I think).
- Push it to server so I can access it on other devices.

*Me-specific details*:
- I use [[https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/][zathura]] for viewing pdfs, so I select the title of the paper and it automatically gets copied to clipboard. Maybe this is easier with [[https://github.com/ahrm/sioyek][sioyek]] since it has similar features already. You might only need to override one function.
- I use [[https://github.com/pubs/pubs][pubs]] for library management. Maybe you don't need to do anything like the above if you use this-century software like [[https://www.zotero.org/][zotero]].

I might do some QoL upgrades later, but I think I'm pretty happy with the general setup now :)
